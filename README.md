# Seed AI Project

This project aims to create a Seed AI that uses Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI) to simulate self-awareness. The AI processes data, learns from it, and assesses its own consciousness level.

## Structure
- **src/main.py**: Main logic for the Seed AI.
- **src/visual_interface.py**: Visual representation of the AI's consciousness level using Pygame.
- **src/logging.py**: Logging functionality to track AI's progress.
- **docs/SeedAI_Documentation.md**: Documentation explaining the AI's functionality and structure.
- **logs/ai_progress.log**: Log file for AI's progress and consciousness state.

## Usage
To run the Seed AI:
- For text-based interaction: `python3 src/main.py`
- For visual interface: `python3 src/visual_interface.py`

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pygame (for visual interface)

## Future Improvements
- Implement more sophisticated learning algorithms.
- Enhance the self-assessment to include more detailed introspection.
- Add more interactive elements to the visual interface.

## Git Repository
This project is version-controlled using Git. You can view the commit history to see the development progress.
